## RAG with web pages. By Yago LÃ³pez

- This proof of concept allows to make questions about the contents of a web page and get answers
- It uses **RAG**: Retrieval Augmented Generation
  - In-memory Vector Database
  - Mistral Embeddings: to create vectorial representations of un-structured information (text)
  - Similarity Search
  - Mistral LLM

- The user must provide the URL to the web page
- The answer is scoped to the web page text. . If the question is not related to the web page the AI will not be able to provide a response. This avoid hallucinations that happen with general chat bots
